HAIRY POUTER, a film designed entirely by AI. Directed by Chris Carboni. Sound by Ambrose Yu. Music by Charles Di Raimondo.<br />
<br />
Lillian is 98. She just finished reading HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER&rsquo;S STONE. This is her book review as interpreted by an AI image generator.<br />
<br />
We wanted our visuals to be infused with the same unexpected interpretive qualities found in Lillian&rsquo;s descriptions. The goal was to take a beloved, iconic story known the world over and put it in the hands of possibly the only two collaborators with the ability to spin it into something new.<br />
<br />
Lillian&rsquo;s creative recap of this familiar story is taken through a funhouse hall of mirrors by inputting her prompts into an AI image generator without any added context that might guide it&rsquo;s interpretation toward the original source material. And thus, a new classic is born. We&rsquo;ll let the world decide which version is best.<br />
